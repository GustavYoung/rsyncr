Awesome useful `rsync` convenience wrapper for Python 2.
Does the heavy lifting of finding potential problems, plus detects potential moves.

We recommend using `PyPy`, which appears to operate order(s) of magnitude faster during the (inefficient) file tree computations.


## Installation ##
```
pip install rsyncr
```

## Usage ##
```
rsyncr <target-path> [options]
```
with options:
```
Copy mode options (default: update):
  --add                -a  Copy only additional files (otherwise updating only younger files)
  --sync               -s  Remove files in target if removed in source, including empty folders
  --simulate           -n  Don't actually sync, stop after simulation
  --force-foldername   -f  Sync even if target folder name differs
  --force              -y  Sync even if deletions or moved files have been detected
  --ask                -i  In case of dangerous operation, ask user interactively

Generic options:
  --flat       -1  Don't recurse into sub folders, only copy current folder
  --compress   -c  Compress data during transport, handle many files better
  --verbose    -v  Show more output
  --help       -h  Show this information
  --help      -h  Show this information
```
